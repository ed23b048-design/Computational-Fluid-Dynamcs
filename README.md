# Computational-Fluid-Dynamcs

In this repository we will see the idea behind CFD. 
Computational Flud dynamics has three processes:

1) Preprocessing: In this process we first decritize the domain in small tiny contol volumes
2) Solver: In this process we convert the governing partial differential dfferential equation into algebric equations and solve t
3) Post processing: In this process we plot/visualize the result got from the solving using vector/streamline plot.
